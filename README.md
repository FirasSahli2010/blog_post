blog opdracht

Here is my answer to your excercise to build a simple blog website using Django 3.
In  this version I've done all the required points:
* The super user can add posts using the console or the admin panel (user name: admin, password: abc)
* a visitor can display posts 
  - The posts are displayed in pages  
  - Each page contains 5 posts 
* a visitor can add comments to every post
* every comment contains a name (visitor name) and the comment 
* when the visitor presses on the title of every post in post display page he goes to the post details page, here he can see the complete post and all the comments on the post with the name of the visitor who has added this comment
* the comments on every post are displayed in pages every page contains 5 comments
